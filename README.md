# odin_recipes

An project assignment by The Odin Project

I created the index.html as my first page in the directory.
Added the basic html boilerplate using the shortkey (! + enter) in vscode.
Then I needed to create another directory named recipes to store all the html pages that i will link to the homepage (index.html).
I used the terminal command mkdir ./recipes to accomplish that.

Creating recipe pages:

The first page took a lot of time as compared to the others as once i created veg_biryani.html, I used it as a prototype (Boilerplate) to create other two pages.
All i needed to do is to replace all the content in the page with the new recipe content as the structure for the pages are similar.

I stored all the images used in the pages in a separate directory named Images.

During all of this, i made a total of 10 commits (not counting the commit i will made to modify readme.md).

THE_END.

Added basic CSS to the pages as per the assignment requirements of the lesson "The Cascade".
