    <h2 class="mini headline">Description</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Chana masala is a vibrant and flavorful Indian dish that showcases the
      harmonious blend of spices and the rich taste of chickpeas. This
      vegetarian delight has its roots in North Indian cuisine and has gained
      popularity worldwide for its aromatic and robust flavors. The star
      ingredient, chickpeas, is simmered in a thick, tangy tomato-based gravy
      infused with an array of spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and
      garam masala. These spices lend depth and complexity to the dish, creating
      a perfect balance between heat and earthiness. The result is a hearty and
      satisfying dish that can be enjoyed on its own or paired with fluffy
      basmati rice, naan bread, or roti.

    <p class="paragraph">
      The flavors of chana masala are further enhanced with the addition of
      onions, garlic, and ginger, which provide a savory base for the dish. The
      tanginess of tomatoes complements the spices, while a hint of lemon juice
      adds a refreshing zing. The dish often incorporates fresh cilantro for a
      burst of freshness and a touch of green color. Chana masala is not only
      delicious but also nutritious, as chickpeas are an excellent source of
      plant-based protein and dietary fiber. Its versatility allows it to be
      served as a main course, a side dish, or even as a filling for wraps or
      sandwiches. Whether enjoyed in the comfort of your home or at an Indian
      restaurant, chana masala is a culinary delight that tantalizes the taste
      buds and showcases the richness of Indian cuisine.

    <h2 class="mini headline">Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li class="margin paragraph color">
        Grind onion, tomato, ginger, garlic, and chile pepper together in a food
        processor into a paste.
      </li>
      <li class="margin paragraph color">
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry bay leaves in
        hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour the paste into the
        skillet and cook until the oil begins to separate from the mixture and
        is golden brown in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Season the mixture with chili
        powder, coriander, gram masala, turmeric, and salt; cook and stir until
        very hot, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li class="margin paragraph color">
        Stir enough water into the mixture to get a thick gravy; bring to a boil
        and stir chickpeas into the gravy. Reduce heat to medium and cook until
        the chickpeas are heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.
